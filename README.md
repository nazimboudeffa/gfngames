# GeForce NOW Games List
Bug Tracker of the GFNList App

# GFNList went private ?

It's weired to see that people just make clones of sites that are hardely coded, particulary when they don't contribute, so it's a change that I assume because you have to know that nobody has given any donation or have given any help

So, the repo went into a Bug Tracker, happy coding everyone ! 

PS : May be I'll change my mood later but am really angry
