# GeForce NOW Games List
Bug Tracker of the GFNList App, in case gfnlist go private and you don't see it public on GitHub

# Why GFNList should go private ?

It's weired to see that people just make clones of sites that are hardely coded, particulary when they don't contribute, so it's a change that I assume because you have to know that nobody has given any donation or have given any help

So, the repo went into a Bug Tracker 

PS : May be I'll change my mood later but am really angry atm

Still happy coding everyone !
